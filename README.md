Credit_Card_Dashboard_Project

Project Name – Credit Card Transaction and Customer weekly Report.
 
Project Objective:
I developed an interactive Credit Card Dashboard utilizing transaction and customer data to provide real-time insights into key performance metrics such as revenue, transaction count, and customer satisfaction. 
By streamlining data processing, the dashboard enables comprehensive trend analysis and delivers actionable insights, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions efficiently.
The project is divided into the following steps:

• Loading the Data into Power BI:
 I imported the transaction and customer data to start building the foundation of the dashboard. 🔄📥

• Data Processing & DAX Queries:
Here, I performed data transformation, calculations, and used DAX functions to create custom columns. 🔢⚙️ This helped generate insightful metrics and key performance indicators.

• Sharing Insights:
 Finally, I generated actionable insights from the report.
